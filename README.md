## Dependencies

This project was developed on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
It requires type definitions for [THREE.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/), [Chart.js](https://github.com/chartjs)
and [js-yaml](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml). They can be obtained with the following commands:

```
npm install --save-dev @types/three
npm install --save-dev @types/js-yaml
npm install --save-dev @types/chart.js
```

This project also includes [THREE.js example classes](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/js) for line rendering and camera control.
In order to have the TypeScript compiler recognize them, the following lines must be addded to
`node_modules/@types/three/src/Three.d.ts`:

```js
/* Examples imports */
/* Example lines */
export * from '../examples/jsm/lines/Line2';
export * from '../examples/jsm/lines/LineGeometry';
export * from '../examples/jsm/lines/LineMaterial';
/* OrbitControls */
export * from '../examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls';
```
